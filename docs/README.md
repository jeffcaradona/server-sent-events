# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation set for the Server-Sent Events working demo. The
documents here explain how the demo is organised, the lifecycle of the SSE
connection, and the architectural decisions that balance functional techniques
with pragmatic state handling.

- [Working demo walkthrough](./working-demo.md) — end-to-end tour of the server
  and browser behaviour, including lifecycle notes and functional design
  choices.
- [Diagrams](./diagrams/) — Mermaid source for the sequence and flow charts that
  illustrate the SSE connection and client event handling.

All Mermaid files (`*.mmd`) can be rendered by GitHub directly or by using the
VS Code "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension.
